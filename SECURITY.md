# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting a Vulnerability

At ClubVerse, we take security very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### üìù Reporting Process

1.  **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.
2.  Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/your-username/clubverse/security) of the repository.
3.  Click on "Report a vulnerability" to start a private discussion.
4.  Please include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and its potential impact.

For more information, see GitHub's documentation on [privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours.
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days.
- **Resolution**: Timeline will vary based on the severity and complexity of the issue.

## üîí Security Measures

### Code Security

- All code changes undergo security review during the pull request process.
- We plan to use Dependabot for regular dependency updates.
- We plan to implement automated security scanning for known vulnerabilities.

### Data Security

- ClubVerse is designed to handle user data, including names, emails, and roles. We are committed to protecting this data.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is planned to be handled by Firebase Authentication, providing a secure and robust system.
- **Database**: User data will be stored in a secure database (like Firebase Firestore), and access will be protected by strict security rules.
- **Data in Transit**: All communication between the client and server will be encrypted using HTTPS.

### Browser Security

- We aim to implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).
- We will enforce HTTPS-only access.
- We will use secure cookie configurations and XSS protection headers.

## üîÑ Version Support

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1.  **Code Review**: Follow secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP Top 10). Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs.
2.  **Dependencies**: Use only trusted packages and keep them up to date. Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
3.  **Testing**: Include tests for security-related functionality, such as permission checks.

### For Users

1.  **Account Security**: Use a strong, unique password for your account. Enable multi-factor authentication if it becomes available.
2.  **Data Safety**: Be mindful of the personal information you share in public club spaces.
3.  **Browser Security**: Use a modern, updated web browser and report any suspicious behavior.

## üîê Security Features

### Current Implementation

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to different parts of the application is restricted based on user roles (Super Admin, College Admin, etc.).
- **Input Validation**: Forms include basic validation for user-provided data.

### Planned Improvements

- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user login and session management.
- **Firestore Security Rules**: Granular, rule-based access control for all database operations.
- **API Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse of backend resources.
- **Advanced Security Headers**: To protect against common web vulnerabilities like clickjacking and XSS.

## üìã Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Scope

- Frontend application code (`app/`, `components/`, `hooks/`)
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Future backend API routes and database rules
- Dependencies used by the project

### Out of Scope

- Theoretical vulnerabilities without a proof of concept.
- Social engineering attacks.
- Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks.
- Issues requiring physical access to a user's device.
