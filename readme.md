### 📁 **Key Directories and Files**:

- **`app/(roles)/`**: This is the core of the role-based architecture. Each directory contains the specific dashboard and pages for a user role.
- **`app/page.tsx`**: The public-facing landing page. It also handles redirecting logged-in users to their correct dashboard.
- **`components/ui/`**: Contains all the reusable, low-level UI components from `shadcn/ui`, forming the design system.
- **`hooks/useAuth.tsx`**: A critical file that manages user authentication state across the application. All authentication logic currently resides here.
- **🔔 `functions/`**: Firebase Cloud Functions for event notifications and backend services.
- **🔔 `lib/firebase/`**: Firebase SDK configuration and notification services for the frontend.

### 🔔 **Event Notification System**

ClubVerse now includes a **complete Firebase Cloud Functions implementation** for event notifications:

**✅ Features Implemented:**

- **Smart Targeting**: Notifies club members, college-wide audiences, and subscribed users
- **Rich Notifications**: Includes event details, click actions, and custom icons
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and error tracking
- **Security**: Firestore security rules and authenticated topic management
